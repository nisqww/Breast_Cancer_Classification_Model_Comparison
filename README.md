📊 Project Overview
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The dataset includes various features of breast cancer patients and is classified into two categories: benign or malignant tumors.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

Model Selection:

Logistic Regression: A simple linear classification algorithm.
Random Forest: An ensemble method composed of decision trees.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Splitting data into training and test sets.
Calculating model accuracy.
Analyzing classification report and confusion matrix.
Hyperparameter Optimization:

Optimizing Random Forest model's hyperparameters using Grid Search.
🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas: For data processing and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and metrics.
seaborn: For data visualization.
🚀 Results
Logistic Regression: [Accuracy Percentage]%
Random Forest: [Accuracy Percentage]%
It was observed that the Random Forest model provided a higher accuracy rate compared to Logistic Regression. This project serves as a valuable example of how machine learning techniques can be applied to breast cancer diagnosis and classification.
